# SSMS-Spatial-Result-Belgium-Map
The query uses geographic data which i got here : https://github.com/jief/zipcode-belgium <br><br>
By adding the amount of inhabitants by city/zipcode we get a visual representation of the most populated cities on the map <br>

### Result with a "semi-realistic" population (I only filled big cities, the others cities are randomly populated)
